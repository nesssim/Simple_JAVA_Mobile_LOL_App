# League of Legends Champion Viewer

This document provides a technical overview of the League of Legends Champion Viewer application, detailing its functionality, code structure, and the steps taken to implement its features.

## Project Overview

The application displays a list of League of Legends champions in a `RecyclerView`. When a user clicks on a champion, the application navigates to a detailed view of that champion, showing their image, name, and role.

## File Structure

Here are the key files and their responsibilities:

- **`MainActivity.java`**: The main entry point of the application. It hosts the fragments and manages the bottom navigation.
- **`ChampionsFragment.java`**: Displays the list of champions in a `RecyclerView`.
- **`ChampionInfoFragment.java`**: Shows the details of a selected champion.
- **`ChampionAdapter.java`**: The adapter for the `RecyclerView` that binds the champion data to the views.
- **`Champion.java`**: The data model for a champion. It implements the `Parcelable` interface to be passed between fragments.
- **`activity_main.xml`**: The layout for the main activity, containing a `FrameLayout` for fragments and bottom navigation buttons.
- **`champions_fragment.xml`**: The layout for the `ChampionsFragment`, containing the `RecyclerView`.
- **`item_champion.xml`**: The layout for a single item in the `RecyclerView`.
- **`champ_info_fragment.xml`**: The layout for the `ChampionInfoFragment`.

## Technical Implementation

### RecyclerView Setup

The `ChampionsFragment` is responsible for setting up the `RecyclerView`. In the `onCreateView` method, it initializes the `RecyclerView`, sets its `LayoutManager`, and creates and sets the `ChampionAdapter`.

### ChampionAdapter and ViewHolder

The `ChampionAdapter` is responsible for creating and binding the `ViewHolder`s for the `RecyclerView`. The `ChampionViewHolder` holds the views for a single champion item, including an `ImageView` for the champion's image and `TextView`s for their name and role.

### Data Flow

The list of champions is generated by the static `getChampList()` method in the `Champion` class. This list is then passed to the `ChampionAdapter` to be displayed.

### Fragment Navigation

Navigation between fragments is handled by the `FragmentManager`. When a champion is clicked in the `RecyclerView`, the `onItemClick` method in `ChampionsFragment` is called. This method creates a new instance of `ChampionInfoFragment`, passing the selected champion as a `Parcelable` argument. It then replaces the `ChampionsFragment` with the `ChampionInfoFragment` using a `FragmentTransaction`.

### Parcelable Implementation

The `Champion` class implements the `Parcelable` interface, which allows `Champion` objects to be passed between fragments. This is necessary to transfer the champion data from the `ChampionsFragment` to the `ChampionInfoFragment`.

## Steps to Fix the Code

Here are the steps that were taken to fix the code and implement the new features:

1.  **Corrected `ChampionAdapter` Instantiation**: The `ChampionAdapter`'s constructor was updated to accept a `Context` and an `OnItemClickListener`, which were missing in the original implementation.

2.  **Fixed `champions_fragment.xml` Layout**: The `RecyclerView`'s `layout_height` was changed from `0dp` to `match_parent` to ensure it fills the available space.

3.  **Centralized Champion List Creation**: The creation of the champion list was moved to the `getChampList()` method in the `Champion` class to avoid code duplication.

4.  **Created `ChampionInfoFragment`**: A new fragment, `ChampionInfoFragment`, was created to display the details of a selected champion. This included creating the layout file (`champ_info_fragment.xml`) and the fragment class (`ChampionInfoFragment.java`).

5.  **Implemented `Parcelable` in `Champion` Class**: The `Champion` class was modified to implement the `Parcelable` interface, allowing `Champion` objects to be passed as arguments to fragments.

6.  **Added Click Listener to `RecyclerView`**: An `OnItemClickListener` was added to the `ChampionAdapter` to handle clicks on the `RecyclerView` items. When an item is clicked, the `onItemClick` method in `ChampionsFragment` is called, which then navigates to the `ChampionInfoFragment`.
